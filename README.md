# 🏥 Medicare-AI — Health Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

Medicare-AI is a **machine learning–based health prediction project** that focuses on predicting **Heart Disease** and **Diabetes risk** using patient health data.  
The project is built for **educational and academic purposes** to demonstrate data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
- To analyze medical datasets
- To train machine learning models
- To predict health risks based on input parameters

---

## ✨ Features
- Heart Disease risk prediction
- Diabetes risk prediction
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction using trained ML models

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **matplotlib / seaborn** (for analysis & visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts**

---

## 📊 Datasets Used
- **Heart Disease Dataset**
- **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**

Datasets are used strictly for **learning and research purposes**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Handle missing values and encode features
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train ML models
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Predict disease risk based on user input
